Codes used in the manuscript titled "An improved MS2-MCP imaging system with minimal perturbation of mRNA stability"

The word file contains a detailed description of the image analysis procedures. The matlab file "loop_RNA_mito_distance.m" is used to measure the distance between each mRNA and the mitochondrial network. The matlab file "count_colocalizing_RNA_number.m" is used to count the number of mRNAs that co-localize with mitochondria.
